    <p>Drive Talk Mm (“We”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and share information collected from our open source application (the “App”).</p>
    <h2><b>Information Collected</b></h2>
    <p>The only information collected by the App is what is necessary to utilize the Google Drive API functionality. This includes credentials to access a user’s Google Drive account. No other personal information is collected.</p>
    <p>Google Drive API metrics like request counts and errors are also collected, but this data is anonymous and does not contain any information like account names or IP addresses that could identify individual users.</p>
    <h2><b>Use of Information</b></h2>
    <p>We do not use any personal information for marketing or other purposes. Credentials are only used to access a user’s Google Drive as needed for the functionality of the App. Google Drive API metrics help us monitor the health and performance of the App.</p>
    <h2><b>Data Sharing</b></h2>
    <p>We do not share any personal information with third parties. Anonymous Google Drive API metrics may be shared with the GitHub community to help improve the App.</p>
    <h2><b>Security</b></h2>
    <p>We prioritize security and take commercially reasonable steps to secure information collected. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    <h2><b>Contact Info</b></h2>
